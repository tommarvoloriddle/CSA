## Features

- Simulates a RISC-V processor with single-stage and five-stage pipeline architectures.
- Supports basic RISC-V instructions, including arithmetic and memory operations.
- Provides educational insights into CPU pipeline stages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the simulation, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- (Any other prerequisites specific to your project)

### Installation

### Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/riscv-processor-simulation](https://github.com/tommarvoloriddle/CSA/).git
   cd CSA
```


## Usage
To use the RISC-V processor simulation, follow these steps:

### Running the Simulation
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Execute the simulation for the desired pipeline architecture:

For the single-stage core:

``` bash
  python single_stage_core.py --iodir /path/to/input/files
```

For the five-stage core:

``` bash
  python five_stage_core.py --iodir /path/to/input/files\
```

Replace /path/to/input/files with the directory containing your input files.
